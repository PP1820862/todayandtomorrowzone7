    The novel coronavirus pandemic can be the moment
the world pushes back against fear and turns their back at hope.
No one doubts that COVID-19 is one of the direst threats the world
has ever faced. And yet, amidst the confusion and anxiety, there 
are ever stronger signs of hope and solidarity, a sense of, and
desire for, togetherness. It is this spirit of global togetherness
that gives us hope. In this time of crisis, we are all neighbors in
the world, and success will only be achieved when all people, in 
all countries, are protected.
<br><br>
    When the pandemic started all of us was anxious and worried.
But never lose faith and have strength and courage to face 
all these challenges. We can get all through this pandemic together.
Always remember that every day is a blessing and a chance for everything
to be better. We might be in a difficult situation right now, but always
remember that God is always there to help and protect us.
<br><br>
    Even through this coronavirus pandemic, we should look to
God and not lose hope in him. We need to be using this as
an opportunity and discover the godly way of facing trials
and tribulations in our own individual lives and as a community.
We should suffer with joy just like Paul and Silas in the prison
and be patient knowing that after all this pain it will be better 
and those who kept strong and hold of their faith in Christ will
be rewarded more than they’ll ever know by the FATHER. Never
forget that God will willingly try to come through to even the 
most evil of all people to show his very best. If Jesus could
change and turn around the entire life of a persecutor of his
own name (Paul), who’s stopping him now? Miracles can happen.
<br><br>
    This Pandemic is like the iceberg in the Titanic. We took it easy and 
never expected it to cause us such devastation. It suddenly came out
of nowhere and spread throughout the entire world. We are currently 
living in uncertain times with the outbreak of COVID-19; our faith
can be challenged and can be hard to see where God fits in with this
new normal. Even though we feel that we are in the verge of giving up.
Let's hope for a new beginning. When you feel it's the end, start again.
I will end this advocacy with a verse by Philippians 4;6, “Have no anxiety at all;
but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving,
make your requests known to God”.
